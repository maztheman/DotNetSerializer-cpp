Project Summary
===============
This project attempts to deserialize a .NET object.  It is written in native c++ with some platform specific stuff.
I created this project because I could not find any other library that could do what I wanted.
This project was compiled in vc11 (Visual Studio 2012), however I will try to get other builds in soon...


Alpha 0.0.1
=============
New stuff:
  * User Classes
  * System Classes
  * Generic Classes
  * Arrays
  * Most primatives (IntXX, Double, DateTime, string)
  * Multiple Serialized Assemblies

Fixed:
- member references are hooked up properly now.
  
TODO:
- Add build project for MinGW GCC.
- Add build project for GCC.
- Add More types (some primatives not supported, but easily added)
- Make this a LIB not a command line exe, still bundle exec as a example.
- Clean up code
- Try to reduce allocs
- Split up the platform specific crap.
