Project Summary
===============
This project attempts to deserialize a .NET object.
I created this project because I could not find any other library that could do what I wanted.
This is a toy project.

Alpha 0.0.2
===========
- Use cmake to build now
- Should work with any compiler ?
- Code is seprated into library and a example app program


Alpha 0.0.1
=============
New stuff:
  * User Classes
  * System Classes
  * Generic Classes
  * Arrays
  * Most primatives (IntXX, Double, DateTime, string)
  * Multiple Serialized Assemblies

Fixed:
- member references are hooked up properly now.
  
TODO:
- Add More types (some primatives not supported, but easily added)
- Make this a LIB not a command line exe, still bundle exec as a example.
- Clean up code
- Try to reduce allocs
- Use std::variant to hold the different field types.
